# New User Summit Quick Start

This document is intended to serve as a quick-start guide for new Summit users . It is based on recent OLCF training events and includes links to slides and recordings from the events as well as links to relevant OLCF documentation. The ideal learning sequence would be to start with recording at the top of the list and work toward the bottom, however you may skip around based on your level of expericne with OLCF and HPC. Additional topics not included below can also be found in the [OLCF Training Archive](https://docs.olcf.ornl.gov/training/training_archive.html#).
